The-TwoPlus-Earbuds-Problem
Team: Nisha Ramasubramonian, Justin Bowser, Elise Donkor, Rohini Iyengar, Maxwell Barnes

Task: Calculate how many to manufacture to satisfy customer needs as well as profits. Resolve this dilemma and determine the optimal number of TwoPlus Earbuds Xs to manufacture.

Problem Setup: 
Your business analyst forecasts that the demand for TwoPlus Earbuds X will be normally distributed with mean 150 and standard deviation 20. 
The total cost of manufacturing and logistics for each unit is $28.50 and you sell the earbuds at a retail price of $150.00. 
Any earbuds not sold within one month need to be disposed of in an environmentally sustainable way, which will cost the company $8.50 per unit. 
You face the following dilemma: 
  • If you manufacture too many, you may not sell all of them and cause a loss of $37 (the sum of manufacturing and logistics and disposal costs: $28.50 + $8.50) for each earbud left unsold. 
  • If you manufacture too little, you may not have enough for all customers and forego a profit of $121.50 (the difference of the retail price and the cost: $150 – $28.50) for each customer leaving the store without the earbuds.
    You want to know what the optimal number of TwoPlus Earbuds Xs is to manufacture.
